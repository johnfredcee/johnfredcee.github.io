Summary: Initial Post

With the impending demise of Twitter, I felt I needed a space to talk to the world about my coding adventures. I have shipped games when most current professional game developers were shipping nappies. A lot has happened, it seems a shame not to share! Most of the content will be Unreal Engine based as I have wrestled with it, in it's various incarnations, but there's likely to be diversions into Python, Lisp, compiler and tool design, and the the game industry.
